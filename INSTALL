Class-Simple
============

This is a simple object-oriented base class.  There are plenty of oth-
ers that are much more thorough and whatnot but sometimes I want some-
thing simple so I can get just going (no doubt because I am a simple
guy) so I use this.

What do I mean by simple?  First off, I don't want to have to list out
all my methods beforehand.  I just want to use them (Yeah, yeah, it
doesn't catch typos--that's what testing and Class::Std are for :-).
Next, I want to be able to call my methods by $obj->foo(1) or
$obj->set_foo(1), by $obj->foo() or $obj->get_foo().  Don't tell ME I
have to use get_ and set_ (I would just override that restriction in
Class::Std anyway).  Simple!

I did want some neat features, though, so these are inside-out objects
(meaning the object isn't simply a hash so you can't just go in and
muck with attributtes outside of methods), privatization of methods is
supported, as is serialization out and back in again.
